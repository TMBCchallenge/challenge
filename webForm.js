/**
 * This a JavaScript class that manages a web form, including functionality for validating fields and submitting form values.
 * The template of the web form is not included, nor is it needed to complete this activity.
 *
 * Instructions:
 *
 * (1) Implement the validateForm() function.
 *      - Should return a boolean: return true if the form has valid responses, false otherwise
 *      - Should utilize FormValidator.validate() to validate the form fields
 *          (documentation on FormValidator can be found at the bottom of this file)
 *      - If the validate() function returns with validation errors, display the errors in a browser alert
 *      - If the validate() function returns with a failed promise (meaning the API is not available at the moment),
 *          display a browser alert stating "Sorry, please submit this form at a later time."
 *
 *  (2) Can you refactor submitForm() so that it waits to reset the form after we are sure the form responses have been
 *      successfully received by the API?
 *
 *  (3) What is wrong with how we initially set "responses" to the default values of "emptyForm" as well as the implementation
 *      of resetForm()? Can you refactor the inital setting of responses and/or the resetForm() function to achieve the
 *      desired behavior?

/**
 * FormValidator class
 *
 * Methods:
 *  validate()
 *
 *  - Makes a call to the API to ensure that the form responses are valid
 *  - Returns a Promise that, on resolve, returns an object of the structure:
 *      {
 *          valid: boolean;
 *          errors: string[];
 *      }
 *  - Note: Potentially can return in a Promise reject in the case the API is not available in that moment
